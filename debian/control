Description: fast and flexible JavaScript charting library
 The dygraphs library produces interactive, zoomable charts of
 time series purely client-side. Features include:
  - Plots time series without using an external server or Flash
  - Supports high/low bands (confidence intervals) around data series
  - Interactive pan and zoom
  - Displays values on mouseover
  - Adjustable averaging period
  - Extensive set of options for customisation
  - Compatible with the Google Visualisation API (gviz)
 .
 Browser requirements are rather low, but the Canvas element
 is needed, which excludes MSIE < 9 or outside of HTML5 mode.
 .
 The packages in Suggests are only needed to display the
 HTML documentation locally.
